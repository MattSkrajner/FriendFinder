# FriendFinder

This app is supposed to compare a user's responses to questions to the responses of a database of people and then display the most compatible perosn in the database. 
This code is not working, though. Many functions are missing. 
The survey questions exist, but the backend code to record the asnwers and compare them to the database is not functioning.
